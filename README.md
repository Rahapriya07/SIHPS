## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea

Develop a multi-platform, user-friendly navigation system for railway stations that helps passengers locate facilities and destinations within the station. The system should provide real-time directions, accessibility features, and integration with existing railway apps. Passengers can use a mobile app or station kiosks to navigate with confidence, reducing confusion and saving time.


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
1.User Interface:
    Mobile app with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation
    Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers
2.Backend Server:
    Handles user requests for directions
    Provides real-time updates on facility availability or changes in station layout
    Stores navigation paths, user preferences, and accessibility options
3.Database:
    Stores detailed station maps, facility locations, accessibility information, and live updates
    Supports frequent updates to ensure accuracy
4.API Integration:
    Integration with existing railway apps for train schedules and alerts
    Mapping APIs for interactive station maps
    Cloud services (AWS / GCP / Azure) for hosting, notifications, and scalability
## Use Cases
1.Passengers locate ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, or food courts easily.

2.Visually impaired passengers navigate the station using voice guidance.

3.Mobile app provides step-by-step directions from current location to desired facility.

4.Digital kiosks provide quick information and navigation assistance for those without smartphones.

5.Real-time updates reflect changes in station layout or facility availability.
